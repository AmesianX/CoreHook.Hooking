# CoreHook Hooking Module

For [CoreHook](https://github.com/unknownv2/CoreHook), the [Microsoft Detours](https://github.com/Microsoft/Detours) package serves as a good binary hooking module since it supports x86, x86_64, ARM, and ARM64, while [EasyHook](https://github.com/EasyHook/EasyHook) only supports x86 and x86_64. Since .NET Core supports the ARM architecture, we can implement the necessary changes to support all of the previously mentioned architectures for use with CoreHook.
